## ðŸ§  Chain of Thought Prompting (CoT)
**What is Chain of Thought Prompting?**
Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting is a technique where the AI is encouraged to reason step-by-step when solving complex problems. Instead of directly answering a question, the model breaks the process into smaller logical steps, leading to a more accurate and explainable output.

**Example:**
Instead of:
> "Suggest a trip plan for 5 days in Japan."

The AI thinks like:
1. Identify the location â†’ Japan.
2. Understand the duration â†’ 5 days.
3. Retrieve cultural, seasonal, and activity-based data.
4. Distribute activities and locations across 5 days logically.
5. Present the plan in a structured format.
