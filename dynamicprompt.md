Dynamic Prompting
ðŸ“– Concept
Dynamic prompting is the process of generating or modifying prompts at runtime based on user inputs, external data, or application state. Instead of using a fixed prompt, the AI dynamically adapts to context, ensuring more relevant and accurate outputs.

Why itâ€™s useful:
It makes the AI more flexible and context-aware, allowing it to adjust to different user scenarios without manually rewriting prompts.

ðŸ›  How Planora AI Uses It
In Planora AI, dynamic prompting is used to generate personalized travel recommendations by incorporating:

User preferences (budget, travel dates, interests)

Live data (weather, currency rates, events)

AI embeddings for better similarity matching with stored travel content

Example:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const dynamicPrompt = `
Plan a ${user.tripType} trip to ${user.destination} for ${user.days} days.
Budget: ${user.budget}.
Current weather: ${weatherData}.
User interests: ${user.interests.join(", ")}.
Generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary.
